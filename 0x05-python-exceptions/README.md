Python Exceptions
In Python, exceptions are errors that occur during the execution of a program. They disrupt the normal 
flow of the program and need to be handled properly to prevent unexpected termination.
Exceptions can occur due to various reasons, such as invalid inputs, file not found, network errors, and more.

Python has a wide range of built-in exceptions that cover different error scenarios. Some common built-in exceptions include:

SyntaxError: Raised when there is a syntax error in the code.
TypeError: Raised when an operation or function is applied to an object of inappropriate type.
ValueError: Raised when a function receives an argument of correct type but an inappropriate value.
FileNotFoundError: Raised when a file or directory is requested but cannot be found.
ZeroDivisionError: Raised when division or modulo operation is performed with zero as the divisor.
